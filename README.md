# The Brazilian Rosetta Project
The Brazilian Rosetta Project - OCRing Brazilian immigration documents from the 19th century.

## What is this project?
One of my hobbies is genealogical research. This is an immense field - one could write entire books on the topic! During centuries, this was a tedious, slow process of analyzing books and documents in order to find information about one's ancestors - names, dates, locations - anything that could lead to another clue in the vast web of genealogical data that enables a person to connect with his or her forefathers.

With the advent of technology, things are improving significantly. Now, using a computer model, the tedious task of going through thousands of documents in order to find a single name can be reduced to hours. Artificial Intelligence is changing the world progressively, allowing us to focus our energy in other tasks!

## Why immigration documents?
There are many kinds of documents that contain genealogical data: civil registration, church records, census, et cetera, all contribute with valid information. Three of the biggest genealogical websites - FamilySearch, Ancestry and My Heritage - have began slowly experimenting with OCR in order to extract data from documents. Unfortunately, the efforts to apply AI/ML/DL to historical documents isn't as vast as it could be.

Immigration documents are tricky to train - especially since the modelling process won't involve interpreting words in a known vocabulary, but first and last names - and oftentimes from multiple different places. This is precisely why not many people want to tackle this task. Since most efforts going on currently involve church and civil records, thus the idea of extract data from immigration documents.

## Scope
This project will attempt to extract data from documents obtained from the [Brazilian National Archives](https://sian.an.gov.br), and the documents used will be Rio de Janeiro's Immigration documents from the 19th century initially. If the model proves to be efficient, documents from other ports and periods might be OCR'd as well.

## To contribute
Initially, there are two main tasks to be done: the first, will be to prepare the image dataset - I'll make thousands of pages of lists, and it will be necessary to edit and transcribe the files in order to train the model.

The second task will be to develop the model itself.
